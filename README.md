# 👁️ Eye Tracker

## ✨ Overview
Welcome to the **Eye Tracker** project! This innovative application harnesses the power of computer vision to detect eye blinks in real-time using your webcam. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, it analyzes facial landmarks and delivers a seamless user experience, whether for accessibility, gaming, or interactive applications.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Real-Time Blink Detection**: Instantly identify when the user blinks, enhancing user interaction and engagement.
- **Visual Feedback**: The application provides visual cues indicating whether the eyes are open or closed, ensuring a user-friendly interface.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Communicates blink detection status in real-time, allowing for versatile use cases, including integration with web applications.

## 🖼️ How It Works
The Eye Tracker processes video frames from your webcam and utilizes MediaPipe’s powerful face mesh model to detect and track facial landmarks around the eyes. By measuring the distance between the upper and lower eyelids, the application can determine whether the eyes are open or closed, effectively detecting blinks.

### 🎨 User Interface
The application features an intuitive user interface that visually represents the eye-tracking process, making it easy to understand and use.

## 💡 Use Cases
- **Accessibility**: Assist users with disabilities by enabling hands-free control through blink detection.
- **Gaming**: Create immersive gaming experiences that react to user blinks for enhanced interactivity.
- **Research**: Utilize the technology for studies in psychology or human-computer interaction.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
The Eye Tracker project aims to continuously evolve with potential enhancements, including:
- Multi-face tracking capabilities for group interactions.
- Advanced analytics on user behavior based on blink patterns.
- Integration with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments.

## 🛠️ Built With
